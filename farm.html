										<h3>Member Testimonials...</h3>
										<p>
											WeI have been a member since 1988 and have always told my family that my annual grits welfare statement is the single most important and anticipated piece of mail that arrives at our house! It's been very gratifying to see that I can look forward to a very comfortable after age 65 based on the exceedingly impressive returns of this well-run the plan. A big thank you to everyone responsible!</p>

									  <h3>Memebr Testimonials....</h3>
										<p>I consider myself very fortunate to be a Grits member  and would consider myself &ldquo;very concerned&rdquo; about key  welfare planning topics. I feel everyone will facing a retirement income crisis. I am concerned that statistics show a growing percentage of persons unable to save for retirement as fewer full-time positions exist, as pensions become increasingly rare in the private sector and as the cost of living continues to escalate."</p>
